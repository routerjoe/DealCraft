## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: AI Quality Inconsistency

**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Document reasoning methodology clearly
- Include confidence scores
- Require human review before finalization
- Provide editable templates
- Reference source data

### Risk: OEM Partner Strategy Conflicts
**Impact:** Medium - Competing recommendations  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Document OEM overlap areas
- Provide complementary positioning
- Include exclusivity clauses
- Allow multi-vendor strategies
- Reference competitive analysis

### Risk: Customer Profile Accuracy
**Impact:** High - Incorrect assumptions lead to poor plans  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Validate with sales team
- Include data sources
- Support profile updates
- Allow manual overrides
- Document assumptions clearly

### Risk: Obsidian Export Path Conflicts
**Impact:** Low - Files overwrite existing plans  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Include timestamps in filenames
- Version control for plans
- Backup existing files
- Support custom export paths
- Document naming conventions

## Validation Steps

### 1. Local API Testing

```bash
# Test account plan generation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/account-plans/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer": "AFCENT",
    "oem_partners": ["Cisco", "Nutanix"],
    "fiscal_year": "FY26",
    "format": "markdown"
  }'

# Expected: 200 with "not_implemented": true

# Test formats endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/account-plans/formats

# Expected: 200 with format list
```

### 2. Python Tests

```bash
# Run account plans tests
pytest tests/test_account_plans_stub.py -v

# Verify all pass with stub responses
```

### 3. Header Validation

```bash
# Check response headers
curl -i http://localhost:8000/v1/account-plans/formats | grep -E "x-request-id|x-latency-ms"
```

### 4. Documentation Review

```bash
# Verify docs exist
cat docs/sprint_plan.md
cat docs/guides/ai_account_plans.md
```

## Notes

- Account plans focus on AFCENT and AETC initially
- OEM strategies: Cisco (networking), Nutanix (HCI), NetApp (storage), Red Hat (Linux/OpenShift)
- AI reasoning uses existing forecast data and opportunity analysis
- Plans exported to Obsidian 50 Dashboards for visibility
- Full implementation in development phase will include:
  - OpenAI/Anthropic integration for reasoning
  - Template-based plan generation
  - PDF export via markdown â†’ PDF conversion
  - Interactive plan refinement

---

**Next Steps After Sprint:**
1. Implement AI reasoning engine
2. Create plan templates for AFCENT/AETC
3. Add OEM partner strategy library
4. Build PDF export pipeline
5. Set up automated plan refresh (quarterly)
