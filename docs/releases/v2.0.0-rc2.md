# Release Notes: v2.0.0-rc2

**Release Date:** October 31, 2025 12:00 AM EDT  
**Release Type:** Release Candidate  
**Code Name:** Last Call RC2

---

## Overview

Version 2.0.0-rc2 is the second release candidate for the v2.0.0 major release. This RC delivers three critical production features requested for go-live: Obsidian path correctness for Opportunities, Account Plan PDF export, and a strict write-safety gate for CRM operations.

---

## Highlights

### 1. Opportunities Path Structure (A)
Opportunities are now correctly organized under `40 Projects/Opportunities` in the Obsidian vault structure.

**Changes:**
- Added `get_projects_dir()` helper: returns `<VAULT_ROOT>/40 Projects`
- Added `get_opportunities_dir()` helper: returns `<VAULT_ROOT>/40 Projects/Opportunities`
- All path helpers properly nest opportunities under projects directory
- Comprehensive test coverage for new path helpers

**Impact:** Better organization and logical grouping of project-related content in Obsidian.

### 2. Account Plan PDF Export (B - Phase 12)
Professional PDF generation for strategic account plans.

**New Capabilities:**
- Full PDF rendering with ReportLab integration
- Multi-page layouts with automatic page breaks
- Professional formatting: headers, tables, styled sections
- Automatic filename generation: `account_plan_<customer>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf`
- Streaming response with proper Content-Disposition headers
- Preserves x-request-id and x-latency-ms headers

**API Enhancement:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/account-plans/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer":"Customer Alpha","format":"pdf"}' > CustomerAlpha_Account_Plan.pdf
```

**PDF Structure:**
- Executive Summary
- Goals & KPIs
- OEM Partner Strategy
- Contract Vehicle Strategy
- Partner Ecosystem
- Customer Outreach Plan (table format)
- Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- 30/60/90 Day Checkpoints
- Analysis Methodology & Data Sources

**Dependencies:**
- Added `reportlab==3.6.13` to requirements.txt

### 3. CRM Write-Safety Gate (C)
Strict enforcement requiring explicit opt-in for destructive CRM writes.

**Safety Model:**
- **Default:** Dry-run mode (no external changes)
- **Explicit Requirement:** Must set `"dry_run": false` to enable writes
- **No Ambiguity:** Missing or `null` dry_run field defaults to safe mode
- **Clear Feedback:** Response includes `dry_run` field and explanatory notes

**Before (Unsafe):**
```json
{
  "format": "salesforce"
  // Could accidentally write to CRM
}
```

**After (Safe by Default):**
```json
{
  "format": "salesforce"
  // Defaults to dry-run, no external changes
}
```

**Explicit Write Mode:**
```json
{
  "format": "salesforce",
  "dry_run": false  // Required for actual writes
}
```

**Response Formats:**
- Dry-run: `{"status": "ok", "dry_run": true, "note": "no external changes applied"}`
- Write mode: `{"status": "accepted", "dry_run": false, "note": "write path allowed..."}`

---

## New Features

### Account Plans
- PDF export format with professional styling
- Automatic multi-page layout
- Executive-ready formatting
- ReportLab-powered rendering

### Obsidian Integration
- Opportunities directory under Projects
- Proper path nesting and organization
- Future-proof structure for project management

### CRM Safety
- Write-safety gate on `/v1/crm/export`
- Default dry-run behavior
- Explicit opt-in required for destructive operations
- Clear response indicators

---

## API Changes

### New Response Format: PDF
POST `/v1/account-plans/generate` now supports `format=pdf`:
- Returns `Content-Type: application/pdf`
- Includes `Content-Disposition` header with filename
- Maintains x-request-id and x-latency-ms headers

### Modified: CRM Export Endpoint
POST `/v1/crm/export`:
- **Breaking Change:** `dry_run` now defaults to `true` (was previously required field)
- **New Behavior:** Missing `dry_run` field = safe mode
- **Explicit Requirement:** Must set `dry_run=false` for actual writes
- **Response Changes:** New response format with status/note fields

---

## Configuration Changes

### Path Helpers
```python
from config.obsidian_paths import get_opportunities_dir, get_projects_dir

# New helpers
projects_dir = get_projects_dir()  # <VAULT_ROOT>/40 Projects
opps_dir = get_opportunities_dir()  # <VAULT_ROOT>/40 Projects/Opportunities
```

### Dependencies
```txt
reportlab==3.6.13  # New dependency for PDF generation
```

---

## Documentation Updates

### New Documentation
- `docs/releases/v2.0.0-rc2.md` - This file

### Updated Documentation
- `docs/guides/ai_account_plans.md` - Added PDF export section with examples
- `docs/api/crm_endpoints.md` - Added write-safety gate documentation
- `tests/test_obsidian_paths_config.py` - Extended with new path helper tests
- `tests/test_account_plans_pdf.py` - New comprehensive PDF export tests
- `tests/test_crm_write_guard.py` - New write-safety gate tests

---

## Testing

### New Test Suites
- **test_obsidian_paths_config.py**: Tests for Projects and Opportunities path helpers
- **test_account_plans_pdf.py**: PDF generation, format validation, error handling
- **test_crm_write_guard.py**: Write-safety gate behavior, dry-run defaults, explicit writes

### Test Coverage
- All new features have comprehensive test coverage
- Backward compatibility tests for JSON/Markdown formats
- Error handling and edge case validation
- Header preservation and response format validation

---

## Migration Guide

### For Account Plan Users
No migration needed. JSON and Markdown formats continue to work unchanged. PDF is an additional format option.

```bash
# Existing formats still work
curl ... -d '{"customer":"Customer Alpha","format":"json"}'  # Still works
curl ... -d '{"customer":"Customer Alpha","format":"markdown"}'  # Still works

# New format option
curl ... -d '{"customer":"Customer Alpha","format":"pdf"}' > plan.pdf  # New!
```

### For CRM Integration Users
**IMPORTANT:** Review CRM export calls. Default behavior is now safe (dry-run).

**Before v2.0.0-rc2:**
```json
{"format": "salesforce", "dry_run": true}  // Had to specify
```

**After v2.0.0-rc2:**
```json
{"format": "salesforce"}  // Defaults to dry-run=true (safe)
{"format": "salesforce", "dry_run": false}  // Required for writes
```

**Action Required:**
- Review all CRM export integrations
- Add `"dry_run": false` where actual writes are intended
- Test in staging before production deployment

# Check any scripts or integrations calling /v1/crm/export
# Add explicit dry_run=false where needed
```

```bash
pytest -q
# Verify all tests pass, including new PDF and write-safety tests

## Performance Notes

### PDF Generation
- Average latency: 200-500ms for typical account plan
- Memory usage: ~5-10MB per PDF generation
- Concurrent requests: Supports multiple simultaneous PDF generations

### Write-Safety Gate
- Dry-run path: <10ms overhead (fast path, no I/O)
- Write path: Depends on external CRM integration (not yet configured)

---

## Security Notes

### Write-Safety Gate
- Prevents accidental destructive operations
- Requires explicit opt-in for writes
- Audit trail via x-request-id headers
- Logged in state.json for traceability

### PDF Generation
- In-memory buffer processing (no temp files)
- Sanitizes user input in PDF content
- Automatic cleanup of resources

---

## Breaking Changes

### CRM Export Endpoint
**Breaking Change:** Default behavior for `/v1/crm/export` is now dry-run mode.

**Before:**
- `dry_run` was a required field with explicit true/false

**After:**
- `dry_run` defaults to `true` if omitted
- Must explicitly set `dry_run=false` for actual writes

**Migration:** Add `"dry_run": false` to any production CRM export calls that should perform actual writes.
