## Best Practices

### Plan Generation

1. **Start with One OEM** - Focus on primary partner first
2. **Validate Customer Profile** - Ensure current information
3. **Include Forecast Data** - Reference real opportunities
4. **Review AI Reasoning** - Check confidence scores
5. **Customize Templates** - Adjust for customer specifics

### OEM Strategy

1. **Lead with Strength** - Position OEM's core capability
2. **Address Competitors** - Acknowledge and differentiate
3. **Provide References** - DoD success stories
4. **Show ROI** - TCO analysis and business case
5. **Timeline Realistic** - Account for federal procurement

### Collaboration

1. **Share in Obsidian** - Team visibility and feedback
2. **Version Control** - Track plan iterations
3. **Regular Updates** - Quarterly refresh minimum
4. **Stakeholder Review** - Sales, SEs, management
5. **Track Metrics** - Measure plan effectiveness

## Limitations

- **AI Accuracy:** Recommendations are suggestions, not guarantees
- **Data Freshness:** Based on available forecast/opportunity data
- **Customer Dynamics:** May not reflect recent organizational changes
- **Competition:** Intel on competitors may be incomplete
- **Budget Constraints:** Assumes historical spending patterns

## Future Enhancements

Planned for post-Sprint 12:
- **Interactive Refinement** - Chat interface for plan iteration
- **Competitive Intelligence** - Integration with GovWin/Bloomberg
- **Budget Tracking** - Real-time federal spending data
- **Success Prediction** - ML model for win probability
- **Automated Updates** - Quarterly plan refresh
- **Multi-Customer Plans** - Theater-wide strategies
- **Template Library** - Pre-built plans for common scenarios
