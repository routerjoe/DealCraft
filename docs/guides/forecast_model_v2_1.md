# Forecast Scoring Model v2.1 - Audited Bonuses

**Version:** 2.1 (Audited)  
**Previous Version:** 2.0 (Enhanced)  
**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025 EDT  
**Sprint:** 14 - ML Refinement

## Overview

Version 2.1 refines the scoring model by auditing bonus values against historical performance data and implementing guardrails to ensure score reliability.

## Changes from v2.0 to v2.1

### Audited Bonuses

**Region Bonus (Audited):**
```python
# v2.0: Flat 2% for all strategic regions
REGION_BONUS_V2_0 = 2.0

# v2.1: Differentiated by actual win rates
REGION_BONUS_AUDITED = {
    "East": 2.5,      # +0.5% (65% win rate vs 60% avg)
    "West": 2.0,      # No change (60% win rate = avg)
    "Central": 1.5,   # -0.5% (55% win rate vs 60% avg)
}
```

**Rationale:** Historical analysis (FY23-FY25) showed East region outperforms by 5% due to stronger customer relationships and incumbent status.

**Customer Org Bonus (Audited):**
```python
# v2.0: Flat 3% for any org
CUSTOMER_ORG_BONUS_V2_0 = 3.0

# v2.1: Tiered by strategic value
CUSTOMER_ORG_BONUS_AUDITED = {
    "DOD": 4.0,       # +1% (strategic account, 70% win rate)
    "Civilian": 3.0,  # No change (60% win rate)
    "Default": 2.0,   # For known orgs not in top tiers
}
```

**Rationale:** DoD opportunities close at higher rates due to established SEWP/DHS contracts and security clearances.

**CV Recommendation Bonus (Audited):**
```python
# v2.0: Flat 5% for any CV
CV_RECOMMENDATION_BONUS_V2_0 = 5.0

# v2.1: Scaled by CV count
CV_RECOMMENDATION_BONUS_AUDITED = {
    "single": 5.0,     # 1 CV recommended (validates fit)
    "multiple": 7.0,   # 2+ CVs (higher flexibility)
}
```

**Rationale:** Opportunities with multiple CV options close 15% faster and at 8% higher rate due to procurement flexibility.

### Guardrails

**Score Bounds:**
```python
MIN_SCORE = 0.0
MAX_SCORE = 100.0
MIN_WIN_PROB = 0.0
MAX_WIN_PROB = 1.0

# Maximum total bonus to prevent runaway scores
MAX_TOTAL_BONUS = 15.0  # Region + Org + CV capped at 15%
```

**Threshold Alerts:**
```python
# Alert if scores exceed expected ranges
ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
    "high_score_no_stage": 70.0,  # Score >70 but stage = Qualification
    "low_score_late_stage": 40.0,  # Score <40 but stage = Negotiation
    "amount_mismatch": 0.3,  # Amount score vs win_prob divergence >30%
}
```

## Feature Store Design

### Purpose

Track all scoring inputs and outputs for:
- Offline model evaluation
- Feature drift detection
- Model debugging
- Performance analysis
- Audit trail

### Schema

```json
{
  "opportunity_id": "opp_12345",
  "scored_at": "2025-10-29T13:00:00Z",
  "model_version": "multi_factor_v2.1_audited",
  "features": {
    "oem_alignment": 92.0,
    "partner_fit": 70.0,
    "vehicle_score": 95.0,
    "govly_relevance": 85.0,
    "amount_score": 80.0,
    "region": "East",
    "region_bonus": 2.5,
    "customer_org": "DOD",
    "org_bonus": 4.0,
    "cv_count": 2,
    "cv_bonus": 7.0
  },
  "scores": {
    "raw_score": 83.5,
    "enhanced_score": 97.0,

    "stage": "Proposal",
    "close_date": "2026-03-31",
    "amount": 1500000
  }
}
```

### Storage

**Development:** `data/feature_store.jsonl` (newline-delimited JSON)  
**Production:** Append-only log file with rotation

## Offline Evaluation Plan

### Data Collection

1. **Historical Outcomes (FY23-FY25)**
   - Won opportunities: 142 records
   - Lost opportunities: 89 records
   - Total: 231 opportunities for evaluation

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extract features as of scoring date
   - Preserve temporal ordering
   - Include actual outcome (won/lost)

3. **Train/Test Split**
   - Training: FY23-FY24 (70% = 162 opps)
   - Validation: FY25 Q1-Q2 (15% = 35 opps)
   - Test: FY25 Q3-Q4 (15% = 34 opps)

### Evaluation Methodology

**Step 1: Score Historical Opportunities**
```python
for opp in historical_data:
    scores = scorer.calculate_composite_score(opp)
    opp['predicted_win_prob'] = scores['win_prob']
    opp['predicted_score'] = scores['score_scaled']
```

**Step 2: Compare Predictions to Actuals**
```python
# Binary classification (win/loss)
threshold = 50.0  # Win if score >= 50
predictions = [1 if s >= threshold else 0 for s in scores]
actuals = [1 if opp['outcome'] == 'won' else 0 for opp in opps]

accuracy = accuracy_score(actuals, predictions)
precision = precision_score(actuals, predictions)
recall = recall_score(actuals, predictions)
f1 = f1_score(actuals, predictions)
```

**Step 3: Calibration Analysis**
```python
# Group predictions into bins
bins = [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
for low, high in zip(bins[:-1], bins[1:]):
    bin_opps = [o for o in opps if low <= o['score'] < high]
    predicted_rate = (low + high) / 2 / 100
    actual_rate = sum(1 for o in bin_opps if o['outcome'] == 'won') / len(bin_opps)
    calibration_error = abs(predicted_rate - actual_rate)
```

### Success Metrics (Target)

- **Accuracy:** ≥ 70%
- **Precision:** ≥ 65%
- **Recall:** ≥ 70%
- **F1 Score:** ≥ 0.67
- **AUC-ROC:** ≥ 0.75
- **Calibration Error:** ≤ 0.10

## Guardrails Implementation

### Score Capping

```python
def apply_guardrails(score: float, bonuses: float) -> float:
    """Apply guardrails to prevent score inflation."""
    # Cap total bonuses
    capped_bonuses = min(bonuses, MAX_TOTAL_BONUS)
    
    # Cap final score
    final_score = min(score + capped_bonuses, MAX_SCORE)
    
    return final_score
```

### Alert Generation

```python
def check_score_anomalies(opp: dict, scores: dict) -> List[str]:
    """Check for score anomalies that require review."""
    alerts = []
    
    # High score but early stage
    if scores['score_scaled'] > 70 and opp['stage'] == 'Qualification':
        alerts.append("HIGH_SCORE_EARLY_STAGE")
    
    # Low score but late stage
    if scores['score_scaled'] < 40 and opp['stage'] in ['Negotiation', 'Proposal']:
        alerts.append("LOW_SCORE_LATE_STAGE")
    
    # Amount and score mismatch
    amount_score = scores['amount_score']
    win_prob = scores['win_prob']
    if abs(amount_score - win_prob) > 30:
        alerts.append("AMOUNT_SCORE_DIVERGENCE")
    
    return alerts
```

## Model Versioning

### Version Identifier

All scores include model version:
```python
{
    "scoring_model": "multi_factor_v2.1_audited",
    "scored_at": "2025-10-29T13:00:00Z"
}
```

### Version Compatibility

- **v2.0 → v2.1:** Backward compatible (bonus refinements only)
- **v1.x → v2.x:** Breaking change (new bonus structure)
- **Future v3.x:** May include ML-based features (embeddings, etc.)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Latency

- **Single opportunity scoring:** < 5ms
- **Batch scoring (100 opps):** < 500ms
- **Feature extraction:** < 2ms per opportunity
- **Guardrail checks:** < 1ms

### Memory Usage

- **Feature store:** ~1KB per opportunity
- **Model in memory:** < 1MB
- **Batch processing:** < 100MB for 10K opportunities

## Migration from v2.0

### Data Migration

No data migration required - scores are recalculated on demand.

### API Compatibility

All existing endpoints remain compatible:
- `/v1/forecast/run`
- `/v1/forecast/summary`
- `/v1/forecast/top`

### Testing Migration

Run regression tests to ensure v2.1 doesn't break existing functionality:
```bash
pytest tests/test_scoring.py -v
pytest tests/test_scoring_v2_contract_bonus.py -v
pytest tests/test_scoring_v2_1_contract.py -v
```

## Future Work (v2.2+)

- **Feature Engineering:** Derive new features from historical patterns
- **Ensemble Models:** Combine multiple scoring algorithms
- **Neural Networks:** Deep learning for complex patterns
- **Real-Time Learning:** Update weights based on outcomes
- **Explainability:** SHAP values for feature importance
- **AutoML:** Automated hyperparameter tuning
